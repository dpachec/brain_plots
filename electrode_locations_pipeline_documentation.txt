Documentation of how to extract MNI location of electrodes based on the post CT and MRI scans. 
Requirements: 

A folder with MRI scans s01_MRI.nii and s01_CT.nii

1)	Perform ACPC transform on the MRI scans. This can be done using the stolk method, or the 3D slicer method. To do it with the 3D slicer method, use the code in create_fiducials_acpc.py to create the ACPC fiducials. Create a volume rendering of the MRI first (go to main drop out menu > volume rendering). Then locate them in their correspondent positions by dragging them in the 3D view and using the sliced views. Anterior comissure, posterior comissure and Interhemispherical point should be defined. Check video 2 of the stolk paper to see example. See images in the reference_images folders to see more examples- When ACPC fiducial positions are determined run the acpc_transformation.py script to perform the transformation (ctrl+G)

2)	Process ACPC transformed MRI with FreeSurfer. Use the script freesurfer_processing.m


After these two initial steps, two options are available for co-registration: 1) 3D slicer and 2) SPM (Stolk et al., 2018 pipeline)

3D slicer
1)	Import the Freesurfer processed MRI (located in subject/freesurfer/mri/T1.mgz) into 3D slicer 
2)	Import the CT scans into 3D slicer 
3)	Corregister the CT scan and the freesurfer processed MRI 
a.	Parameters are important here. Module to use is General Registration (Brains). Look for this module using the lupa in 3D licer 
b.	Fixed image volume = T1
c.	Moving image volume = CT- 
d.	If CT is misaligned, it has to be centered so that it overlaps substantially with the MRI scan. This can be done by selecting the CT and right click > Edit Properties.  Volume information tab, change the image origin values. Percentage of samples (0.02). The default is 0.002, and does not produce good results. Output settings: Slicer linear transform > Create new LinearTransform. Registration phases: select only Rigid 6DOF 
e.	 Check that the results are correct both in the 3D view and in the slicer views

Stolk et al., 2018
1)	Use the script spm_corregistration.m to corregister the MRI and CT scans using SPM. Freesurfer processed MRI (subject/freesurfer/mri/T1.mgz) and raw CT scans (***) have to be specified. The script will produce a file s01_CT_acpc_f.nii which then can be loaded into 3D slicer to localize the electrodes. 


After coregistration perform electrode localization
Electrode localization
4)	Localize the electrodes manually using 3D slicer. The coordinates are the same (RAS) as would be obtained in Fieldtrip / Matlab stolk pipeline. Export the coordinates of all electrodes.  A new curve with two points needs to be created (start and end of electrode). Load the create_fiducials.py file into 3D slicer python console using CTRL+G. Specify the first and the last contact points in the electrode. Then call add_fiducials_along_line(string: node_name (e.g. “H”), 10). 

5)	Export all electrodes to a csv file, using the functoin export_all_fiducials, also included in the create_fiducials.py file. Specify output path and it will export all of them (output_path=None). Make sure to specify path with // and not backlash in the other direction, because the string gets confused in the python console if using the “\\” version. Alternatively, use r before the path (e.g., export_all_fiducials(r"D:\Appartment\extract_electrodes\fiducials.csv")

6)	To convert to MNI space, extract the affine matrix transform generated by freesurfer. Use the script electrode_conversion_affine.m to peform this conversion. Check the mne version here for reference: Section FreeSurfer’s MNI affine transformation. https://mne.tools/1.0/auto_tutorials/forward/50_background_freesurfer_mne.html 




Tip: when the anatomical data and electrode info files are ready (raw data), proceess them as a DICOM database in 3D slicer, and then export the ACPC transformed MRI and raw CT's into the working folder
